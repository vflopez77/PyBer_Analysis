# PyBer Analysis
-- Module 5 - PyBer
## Project Overvew
Given city ride data for PyBer, we will compare data from different city types to identify trends and make recommendations to PyBer Managment.
### The analysis of the Pyber Data included these elements:
- A data comparison rides, drivers, and fares for the three different city types:  Rura, Suburban, and Urban.
- A line graph illustrating the fares for each city type over time.

## PyBer Data Summary:

<br>
Urban areas had the most rides and the highest total fares.<br>
Suburban areas had fewer rides, but higher average fares and higher fares per driver.<br>
Rural areas had the fewest rides and total fares, but higher fares per ride and much higher fares per driver.<br>

## PyBer Fares by City Type Over Time:

<br>
In the January-April 2019 time frame in this graph, there are roughly similar proportions of total fares over time for the three city types.<br>

### Pyber Summary
Given the differential in the average fares and fares per driver between the Urban, Suburban, and Rural city types, the following is recommended to increase revenue:<br>
- Increase the number of drivers Rural drivers since they command higher fares than urban or suburban drivers.<br>
- Increase the number of Suburban drivers since they make over twice the fares per driver as urban drivers.<br>
- Keep the Urban driving pool the same as it is providing the majority of the revenue, but at a lower rate per driver.<br>
