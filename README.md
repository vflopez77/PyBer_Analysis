# PyBer Analysis
Module 5 - PyBer
## Project Overvew
Given city ride data for PyBer, we will compare data from different city types to identify trends and make recommendations to PyBer Managment.
### The analysis of the Pyber Data included these elements:
- A data comparison rides, drivers, and fares for the three different city types:  Rura, Suburban, and Urban.
- A line graph illustrating the fares for each city type over time.

## PyBer Data Summary:

Suburban areas had fewer rides, but higher average fares and fares per driver.<br>
Rural areas had the fewest rides and total fares, but higher fares per ride and much higher fares per driver.<br>
